# Vox Nova Rails
Semester project for Justin Schuyler's CS 4085 independent study course. Over the course of the Spring 2016 semester, this repository will be updated week by week with new features and improvements. 

The website is a rails built application for the local vocal ensemble, Vox Nova. This site will allow the adminstration of the group to post on the group's behalf, update information about concerts, members, and news. This will allow for a robust and interactive front end, along with an easy to use administration system for adminstrators to use and keep group information up to date.

### Version
0.0.1

### Tech

Vox Nova uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language
* [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) - model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) - duh
* [RailsAdmin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) - a Rails engine that provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your data
* [Devise] (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden
